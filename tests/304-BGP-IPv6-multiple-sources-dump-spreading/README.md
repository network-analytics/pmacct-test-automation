## Test Description (304-BGP-IPv6-multiple-sources-dump-spreading)

Testing with BGP traffic from 3 senders (mix ipv4 and ipv6), with 3 different source IPs. 
BGP table dump is enabled, and configured to be spread in different intervals (depending on the scenario, see below). 
The goal of this test is to validate functionality of the table dump also with the dump spreading feature.

(pcaps taken from test 302)

### Scenarios:

- Default scenario: single dump every 60s, no spreading
- Scenario 01: dump spread in 8 intervals (every 30s)
- Scenario 02: dump spread in 9 intervals (every 20s)

### Test timeline:

t=0s --> the first full minute after starting the traffic generator

pcaps file time duration: 
- t=1-2s: BGP packets sent (from reproducers 00-02)
